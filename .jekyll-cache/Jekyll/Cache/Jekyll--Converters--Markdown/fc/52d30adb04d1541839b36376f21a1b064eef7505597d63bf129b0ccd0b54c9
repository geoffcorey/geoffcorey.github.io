I"¨<p>This is a Sangria recipe from I have been using from a good friend.Â  Iâ€™m not sure where he got the recipe to give it proper attribution but this makes a great summer drink.Â  Now that the tempeture is warming up and a big time early spring here in North Carolina I figure it would be a good time to share.Â Â  For this recipe I use a good Spanish or Chilean redÂ  table wine.Â Â  It great for parties, hanging out at the pool or just plain relaxing.</p>
