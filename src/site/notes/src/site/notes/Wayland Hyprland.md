Recently moved off nvidia to AMD and i3 WM to Hyprland.   The nvidia move was a no brainer considering all the hoops you have to go through for closed source drivers.  AMD works flawlessly without using closed source drivers.

Hyprland is one of those projects that can have you run down the rabbit hole of endless customization's.   I did that at first with success but found a much simpler starting point.   I use the [JaKooLit Hyprland-Dots](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Hyprland-Dots) and installed for my Arch-based linux system using the installer [Arch-Hyprland](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Arch-Hyprland).  It does a nice job of backing up your .config files it is going to touch.

After install I modify a few things for monitor setup [Monitors.conf](https://github.com/geoffcorey/dotfiles/blob/main/.config/hypr/configs/Monitors.conf#L13-L14) and add my pile of wallpapers that get auto rotated.
