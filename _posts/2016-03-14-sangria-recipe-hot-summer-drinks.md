  <a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.geoffcorey.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Sangria.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-189 alignleft" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.geoffcorey.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Sangria-150x150.jpg?resize=150%2C150" alt="Sangria" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>This is a Sangria recipe from I have been using from a good friend.  I&#8217;m not sure where he got the recipe to give it proper attribution but this makes a great summer drink.  Now that the tempeture is warming up and a big time early spring here in North Carolina I figure it would be a good time to share.   For this recipe I use a good Spanish or Chilean red  table wine.   It great for parties, hanging out at the pool or just plain relaxing.
