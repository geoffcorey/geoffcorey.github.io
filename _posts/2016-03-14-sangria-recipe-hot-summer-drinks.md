This is a Sangria recipe from I have been using from a good friend.  I&#8217;m not sure where he got the recipe to give it proper attribution but this makes a great summer drink.  Now that the tempeture is warming up and a big time early spring here in North Carolina I figure it would be a good time to share.   For this recipe I use a good Spanish or Chilean red  table wine.   It great for parties, hanging out at the pool or just plain relaxing.

## Sangria Recipe Ingredients

  * 1 (750-ml) bottle red wine
  * 1/4 cup brandy
  * 1/4 cup orange flavored liqueur
  * 2 tablespoons lime juice
  * 2 tablespoons orange juice
  * 1/4 cup sugar
  * 1/2 orange, thinly sliced
  * 1/2 lemon, thinly sliced
  * 1 unwaxed apple, cored, and cut into thin wedges
  * 1 (750-ml) bottle sparkling water, chilled

## Sangria Recipe Directions


Combine everything but the sparkling water in a large plastic container or glass pitchers.  Cover and chill completely, 1 to 2 hours.  When ready to serve, add the sparkling water.
