I wanted a new bank account I can use for research without tying up my main personal account.  Why am I not using my personal account?   Well paranoia.  I want to start researching <a title="Bitcoin - Digital Currency" href="https://bitcoin.org/en/" target="_blank">Bitcoin</a> and digital currency and the best way to acquire Bitcoins is through <a title="Bitcoin Wallet - Coinbase" href="https://www.coinbase.com/" target="_blank">Coinbase</a>, which requires a linked bank account.    More on Bitcoin on follow up articles.

So this is the digital age right?  Why do I have to get in my car and drive down the street to start an account?   Well you don&#8217;t.

<a title="Simple Online Bank" href="http://simple.com" target="_blank">Simple</a> is an online bank that is affiliated with Bancorp and they named the bank right!  Sign up on Simple needed your basics:  Name, SSN, Address and Phone.    They take a day or two to verify your information before enabling your account.   Once enabled you download and sign in with an iPhone or Android mobile application and provide a signature using the touchscreen.

A feature I really like is they ask what countries is this account going to be used.   This helps red flag bogus transactions if someone got your debit card.

## Depositing Funds

Funds can be deposited by linking other accounts, setting up direct deposit or just take a picture of a check you want to deposit.   Since I don&#8217;t want to link my other personal accounts I simply wrote myself a check with my personal account and took a picture of the front and back check to deposit with the mobile application.   Accounts newer then 30 days will put a hold on the check for 9 days.

## Using Funds

It&#8217;s a bank so they will issue you a VISA debit card for daily use. They also have all the conveniences of setting up automatic bill pay and fund transfers.

## Activity

The online site is a very simple layout and you can see all transactions on the account and also setup spending and saving goals to manage your budget.
