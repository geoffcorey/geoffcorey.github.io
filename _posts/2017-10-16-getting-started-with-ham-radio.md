Online window shopping this year I saw you could get a
[Baofeng Radio US BF-F9 V2+ 8-Watt Hi-Power (USA Warranty) Dual-Band 136-174/400-489.99 MHz Hand Held Ham Radio Two-Way Transceiver](href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PTJ43FU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00PTJ43FU&linkCode=as2&tag=geoffcorey-20&linkId=3102d098507d9e62b143e88f1902affa)
for less the 50 bucks.  For that price it was a nice way to checkout HAM Radio
and see what it was all about.

I also picked up a
[BTECH PC03 FTDI Genuine USB Programming Cable for BTECH, BaoFeng, Kenwood, and AnyTone Radio](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HUB0ONK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00HUB0ONK&linkCode=as2&tag=geoffcorey-20&linkId=db9fa17254574c18ea0a811b9383b824)
to make it easer to program using
[CHIRP](http://chirp.danplanet.com/projects/chirp/wiki/Home).
CHIRP allows you to pull from various frequency databases and add them to your
HAM radio transceiver very easily.  CHIRP supports a lot of HAM radios.   The
last item I decided to pick up was a better antenna for the handheld radio. I
went with the [MFJ Enterprises Original MFJ-1717S 144/440 MHz Handheld Antenna - SMA-Male](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B013RI0WHC/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B013RI0WHC&linkCode=as2&tag=geoffcorey-20&linkId=35029db4eaa433624ce2266f19f35bcc>)
and also had to get [Valley EnterprisesÂ® SMA Male to BNC Female RF Adapter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ATEMITS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00ATEMITS&linkCode=as2&tag=geoffcorey-20&linkId=06723c471a991d8d26b07983d9efa90c)
for the BaoFeng.   The reception is much better the stock rubber ducky that
comes with the radio.

Normal use of a 2-Meter (144-148 Mhz) and 70cm (420-450 Mhz) bands only work for a
few miles with line of sight.  HAM clubs setup repeaters that extend that range.
With CHIRP you can quickly program those repeaters into your device.

Many of these HAM Clubs such as [South Wake Amateur Radio Club](http://www.southwakearc.com/)
and [Johnson Amateur Radio Society](http://jars.net/) hold nightly "Rag Chews",
traders net and other group discussions.

You cannot transmit until you have a HAM radio license but you can listen all
you want.   I decided to get my Technician Class License so I could transmit on these
bands.  Easiest way I found is to use [Ham Study](https://hamstudy.org/).  Ham
Study is an online flash card study course and you could easily pass the
Technicians License test in about 2 weeks.    Tests are administered by your
local HAM clubs and they typically hold a testing session once a month.  I
highly recommend you apply for a [Federal Registration
Number](http://wireless.fcc.gov/uls/index.htm?job=online_systems) prior to
taking the test.   That way you can use the FRN number when taking the test
rather then use your SSN.  Once you pass your test you just need to wait for
your new callsign to show up in the
[FCC database](http://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/UlsSearch/searchLicense.jsp)
which takes about 10-14 days after you pass the test.

Technician Class license is the lowest license class and still has restrictions
on which bands you are allowed to use.  [ARRL](https://arrl.org) is a great
organization to join and they have nice chart [HAM Radio
Bands](http://www.arrl.org/images/view//Charts/Band_Chart_Image_for_ARRL_Web.jpg)
that will show you the allocations and which license is allowed to use those
bands.   To transmit on the bands that work globally I recommend getting your
General Class License.  No longer required to know Morse code to pass the tests.

As I explore the world of HAM radio there are so many things to do and try I
know I have found a hobby with a lifetime of learning.   Beyond talking there
are digital modes that allow communication on weaker signals, satellite
reception including downloading weather maps and even communication with
International Space Station as it whizzes overhead.
